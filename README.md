# Ressources

These resources are codes that I have written myself or retrieved on the internet.  
 Most of the time or when it's possible, a dataset or an example are available to test by yourself..  

 - [SAS](https://github.com/NicoDupont/Ressources/tree/master/SAS)  (9.X) 
 - VBA
 - SQL
 - Python 3.X

# Resources

These resources are usefull codes that I have written myself or retrieved on the internet and adapted<br>
When the code is not mine. I put a link to the source.<br>
Most of the time or when it's possible, a dataset or an example is available to test by yourself.<br>
Remember there is no support. You need to adapt the example to your problem.<br>
But do not hesitate to send me an email if you see a mistake, to add some improvements or for any question !<br>

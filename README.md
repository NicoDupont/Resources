## Resources

These resources are usefull codes that I have written myself or retrieved on the internet and adapted.      
Most of the time or when it's possible, a dataset or an example is available to test by yourself.      
Do not hesitate to send me an email/message if you see a mistake, to add some improvements or for any question !  
I try to implement my code on each langage that I can use.   
This why you can see same functions/parts on SAS, Python, etc..

## Resources

These resources are usefull codes that I have written myself or retrieved on the internet and adapted.      
Most of the time or when it's possible, a dataset or an example is available to test by yourself.  
Remember there is no support. You need to adapt the code to your problem.  
But do not hesitate to send me an email/message if you see a mistake, to add some improvements or for any question !  
I try to implement my code on each langage that I can use.   
This why you can see same functions/parts on SAS, Python, etc..
